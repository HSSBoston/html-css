- Wrote a simple [website](https://replit.com/@hannassuzuki/CS50xCourseWebsite#answer.html) with HTML and CSS for the "Dive into HTML" assignment in [CS50T](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-understanding-technology).
- Tried out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to generate a [web page of this readme.md](https://hssboston.github.io/html-css/).
